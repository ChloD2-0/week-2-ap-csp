# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Chloe"
name = input("What's your name?")
favorite_num2 = input("What's your favorite number?") 
age = 15
favorite_color = "Red"
favorite_number = 20
num1= 15
num2= 5
answer = (input) 

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())


# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))


# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(first_name + favorite_color )

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print(num1 + num2)


#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
print(f"Hello, {name}! Thanks for telling me that your favorite number is {favorite_num2}! My name is {first_name}.")




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
print(f"My favorite color is {favorite_color}, I am {age} years old, and the sum of {num1} + {num2} is my favorite number, {favorite_number}!")
